Three Divisions
Design  an html page with three divisions(using div tag), which should contains following attributes:

<div> tag 1:                                       <div> tag 2:                                             <div> tag 3:

Name : DAIntelligence                  Name : ASI_Intelligence                     Name : Intelligence-Amp

 

Each division contains a paragraph tag (<p>) with the texts given below:

<p> tag 1: Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)

<p> tag 2: Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

<p> tag 3: Intelligence Amplification (IA)

 Using jQuery finds all the divisions with an attribute name that ends with 'Intelligence' and sets the background color yellow when the user click on the button “Click to see the effect”.

Note:  Do not alter the given 'divisions.html' file.  Write your jQuery code in the file 'divisions.js'
